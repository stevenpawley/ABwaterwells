\title{Function to determine the depth to bedrock based on litholog intervals that
are labelled as either 'Bedrock' or 'Surficial'}
\usage{
pick_bedrock_first(lithologs, response = ".pred_class")
}
\arguments{
\item{lithologs}{tibble of litholog data containing the column '.pred_class'
which as two factor levels, 'Bedrock' and 'Surficial'.}

\item{response}{character, name of column with the labels (either "Bedrock"
or "Surficial")}
}
\value{
tibble containing the bedrock depths per well, with 'gicwellid' and
  '.bedrock_dep' columns.
}
\description{
This function finds the first occurrence of 'Bedrock' in the log and takes
this at the bedrock top, even if other intervals labelled as 'Surficial'
occur beneath first bedrock interval. As such, this represents a minimum
estimate for depth to bedrock and can be affected by glaciotectonic rafts
etc.
