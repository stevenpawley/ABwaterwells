\title{Snap bedrock picks to the log intervals and assign a unit column to either
'Bedrock' or 'Surficial'}
\usage{
lithologs_snap(lithologs)
}
\arguments{
\item{lithologs}{a data.frame/tibble of litholog intervals with 'int_top_dep'
representing the interval top depths, and 'bedrock_dep' defining the picked
bedrock depth in the log.}
}
\value{
a tibble with the modified bedrock depths
}
\description{
Bedrock top picks, often made in 'Viewlog' are not aligned precisely with the
litholog intervals; they often float slightly above or below the interval
boundaries. This function finds the closest interval boundary (top or bottom)
depth to the pick and moves the pick to align precisely with the boundary.
