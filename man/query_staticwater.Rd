\title{Predefined query to extract a table of static water levels}
\usage{
query_staticwater(wells, well_reports, pump_tests)
}
\arguments{
\item{wells}{tibble of 'wells' data that has been metricated. The only
columns that are required are c('wellid', 'gicwellid') but usually you
would also want 'latitude' and 'longitude'.}

\item{well_reports}{tibble of 'wellreports' data that has been metricated.
The required columns are c("wellid", "wellreportid").}

\item{pump_tests}{tibble of 'pumptests' data that has been metricated.
Columns that are required in the pump tests download are c("wellreportid",
"staticwaterlevel", "testdate")}
}

tibble
