\title{Function to determine the depth to bedrock based on litholog intervals that
are labelled as either 'Bedrock' or 'Surficial'}
\usage{
pick_bedrock_last(lithologs, response = ".pred_class")
}
\arguments{
\item{lithologs}{tibble of litholog data containing the column '.pred_class'
which as two factor levels, 'Bedrock' and 'Surficial'.}

\item{response}{character, name of the response variable column, default
is '.pred_class'}
}
\value{
tibble containing the bedrock depths per well, with 'gicwellid' and
  '.bedrock_dep' columns.
}
\description{
This function finds the first occurrence of 'Bedrock' that is below any other
intervals labelled as 'Surficial' in each log. As such, this represents a
maximum estimate of bedrock depth; it avoids the problems with glaciotectonic
rafts of bedrock, but can potentially overestimate bedrock depth if some
intervals are misclassified as surficial with the bedrock strata.
