\title{Join the bedrock picks with the lithologs}
\usage{
lithologs_join(lithologs, picks)
}
\arguments{
\item{lithologs}{a tibble of compiled lithologs}

\item{picks}{a tibble of compiled picks}
}
\value{
the joined data
}
\description{
The ‘gicwellid’ field in the lithologs will represent ‘LOC_NAME_ALT2’ for
logs coming from ABGEOL, and will represent the GIC_WELL_ID for those coming
from AWWID, and also contains UWIs and other local names etc. This was
because original GFM pick compilation had a single gicwellid column that used
LOC_NAME_ALT2 as the identifier for picks made from ABGEOL, so it is the only
column that can be used to relate the picks back to the logs.
}
\details{
Unfortunately, this identifier is not entirely unique and there are some
duplicated ids.

This function joins the picks with the lithologs based on 'id', but also
removes joined locations where the pick coordinates are not within 500 m of
the litholog coordinates. This should not remove more than 3000 picks out of
~ 130,000 otherwise an error is raised.
