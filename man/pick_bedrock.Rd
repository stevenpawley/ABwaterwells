\title{Function to determine the depth to bedrock based on litholog intervals that
are labelled as either 'Bedrock' or 'Surficial'}
\usage{
pick_bedrock(lithologs, response = ".pred_class", option = c("last", "first"))
}
\arguments{
\item{lithologs}{data.table of litholog data containing the column '.pred_class'
which as two factor levels, 'Bedrock' and 'Surficial'.}

\item{response}{character, name of the response variable column, default is
'.pred_class'.}

\item{option}{character, one of c("last", "first"). Indicates whether to
define the top of the bedrock based on the lowermost occurrence of
predicted bedrock that occurs under all other predicted surficial units, or
the uppermost occurrence of predicted bedrock. The default is "last". This
makes the predicted bedrock top less susceptible to the presence of rafted
bedrock rafts, although in some cases could make the predicted bedrock top
too deep, if units in the bedrock have been misclassified as surficial.}
}
\value{
data.table containing the bedrock depths per well, with 'gicwellid'
  and '.bedrock_dep' columns.
}
\description{
This function finds the first occurrence of 'Bedrock' that is below any other
intervals labelled as 'Surficial' in each log. As such, this represents a
maximum estimate of bedrock depth; it avoids the problems with glaciotectonic
rafts of bedrock, but can potentially overestimate bedrock depth if some
intervals are misclassified as surficial with the bedrock strata.
